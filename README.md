# HTML-Primer for eLearning
Learning to work with HTML in Learning Management Systems (LMS) helps improve student user experience by:
* ensuring semantic content presentation,
* compliment organizational brand adherence,
* allow for modularity/reusability of curriculum materials,
* improving accessibility and User Experience (UX) for all students.

The HTML Primer code was developed as a resource for web designers/developers, educators, and support staff working with any LMS tool to:
* easily understand core HTML code,
* visualize predefined styling of content within the LMS,
* comprehend how HTML elements available can be applied to eLearning curriculum,
* encourage an HTML first philosophy.

This HTML Primer is intended to be used as a testing mechanism of an institutions LMS design and capabilities, an educational resource for educators and support staff, and a collection of repeatable HTML code (yes, you will need to look at the HTML) that can be implemented into any webpage within a LMS or CMS. 

## Instructions:
Simply copy and paste the [HTML-Primer.html](/HTML-Primer.html) code into your LMS HTML editor to see how the code is rendered in the LMS you are using.
